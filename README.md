# Dog-Breed-Classifier

Part of the Dog-Breed-Classifier project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree and the general structure of the code and notebook must be attributed to them (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).

Deep learning algorithm which classifies pictures into different dog breeds

Trains a convolutional neural network on images of dogs which can be downloaded at the links below. The network takes a user-supplied image as input and outputs the dog breed that the picture most resembels.
